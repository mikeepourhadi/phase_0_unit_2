## Submitting your work
Sync changes from the master repo by following the steps [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11394349/upstream-pulls-with-the-github-desktop-client). Make sure you follow them step by step. If you experience problems, please attend office hours. It's difficult to diagnose problems relating to git and github via email. 

- If you are doing this from the Github Desktop App, follow [these](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11394349/upstream-pulls-with-the-github-desktop-client
)
directions. 
- If you are doing it from the command line, follow [these](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) directions.

Make sure to include specific commit messages and sync your changes each time you complete a challenge.

You need to submit your work through [this google form]() by Sunday at 11:59pm. Expect to submit the links from your repo for each challenge above.
